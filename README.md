# Simple Typescript Express Server
I am a very lazy developer. I'll only do this once more. This server follows best practices when working with Express and Typescript.
### Getting Started
The entry point is `src/index.ts`. Get started by editing this.
### Scripts
#### `npm run start:dev`
Starts the application in development using `nodemon` and `ts-node` to do hot reloading.
#### `npm run build`
Builds the app at `build`, cleaning the folder first.
#### `npm run start`
Starts the app in production by first building the project with `npm run build`, and then executing the compiled JavaScript at `build/index.js`.
